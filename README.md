#XChat Python Plugins

__Simple general purpose Python plugins/scripts for XChat IRC client__

###Top Channels
This lets you know the channels people hang out at. To get the list of these channels, this plugin
sends a WHOIS command for every user on each channel. 
Then the list of channels for each user is on, is used to rank all of the channels.
*Currently it only displays the list of the channels after every 60 seconds. Final version would write 
the results to a file, and close*


###User Activity Monitor
Friend of yours is online but inactive? Want to get notified when she gets active in the channel?
This simple plug-in might help.
